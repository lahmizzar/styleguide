## Whitespace

Only one style should exist across the entire source of your code-base. Always be consistent in your use of whitespace. Use whitespace to improve readability.

* Never mix spaces and tabs for indentation.
* Choose between soft indents (spaces) or real tabs. Stick to your choice without fail. (Preference: spaces)
* If using spaces, choose the number of characters used per indentation level. (Preference: 4 spaces)
